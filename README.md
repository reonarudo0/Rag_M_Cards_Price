# Rag_M_Cards_Price
Tkinter app used to check Ragnarok M: Eternal Love cards price, displaying them by rarity, price and where to equip
Created by Leonardo Augusto A. L. Lima

There're some problems that I see to fix, and I believe the main problem is the time taken to get all cards price,
and the GUI is pretty ugly right now.
Even toughot the program takes about 2min to open it is faster than checking all prices one by one and you can sort cards by price.
